## Scraper Setup Instructions

To enable scraping, a browser client using Playwright was implemented, since the latest version of Laravel Playwright is not yet optimized for Laravel 12.

### Steps to Start the Scraper

1. Navigate to the `onlyfans-scraper/` directory.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Then start the scraper server with `node server.js`.

The scraper will be available at:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

Make sure to add the following variable to your Laravel `.env` file:

```
SCRAPER_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
```
